  <h1 style="color: aqua;">Hello employee!</h1>
  <h4 style="color: aqua;">You need to become familiar with the basics of your business. Read the following text carefully, you will really need it. </h4>
  <p class="firsttext">In the intricate world of espionage, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) is often portrayed as a bastion of elite operatives with remarkable skills. However, a closer examination reveals that not all agents fit the mold of the suave, tuxedo-clad spy. For instance, many agents are adept at gathering intelligence, but their social skills may leave much to be desired. Picture an agent at a high-stakes dinner party, attempting to blend in while accidentally discussing classified information over dessert. 

    Moreover, there exists a common stereotype that all CIA operatives are masters of disguise. In reality, one might encounter an agent donning a bright orange safety vest while trying to blend in at a construction site. This unfortunate choice of attire can lead to humorous situations, such as being mistaken for a foreman when attempting to gather intel on a suspicious construction project. 
      
    Additionally, the notion that CIA agents are always equipped with the latest gadgets is somewhat exaggerated. While they do have access to advanced technology, there are instances where agents rely on outdated equipment. Imagine an agent attempting to use a rotary phone in a digital world, only to receive puzzled looks from the tech-savvy youth nearby. 
      
    In conclusion, while the image of the CIA agent is often glamorous and mysterious, the reality can be quite different. They may possess extraordinary skills in intelligence gathering, but their social faux pas, fashion mishaps, and outdated gadgets remind us that even the most skilled operatives are still human.
